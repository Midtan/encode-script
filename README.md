# encode.py
Quick and simple little encoding/muxing script for multiple use cases.

This used to be [this](https://gist.github.com/Midtan/3e1424bd9e2e9c2d3fb9d0f57d49a06b).

I vibed so hard on this.

## Dependencies
* ffmpeg and ffprobe
* just install them
* you can find them online
* I believe in you

## Using encoding presets
Put encoding presets into a json file (suggested name ``presets.json``) and put its name into line 22 of the encode.py. Now you won at life.
